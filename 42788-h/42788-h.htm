<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>PREDICTIONS OF THE FIRE AND PLAGUE OF LONDON, NO. II.</h3>

  <p>One of the most striking predictions occurs in Daniel Baker's
  <i>Certaine Warning for a Naked Heart</i>, Lond. 1659. After much
  invective against the evil ways of the metropolis, he proceeds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A fire, a consuming fire, shall be kindled in the bowels of the
  earth, which will scorch with burning heat all hypocrites, unstable,
  double-minded workers of iniquity.... A great and large slaughter shall
  be throughout the land of darkness where the unrighteous decrees and laws
  have been founded. Yea, a great effusion of blood, fire, and smoke shall
  encrease up in the dark habitations of cruelty; howling and great wailing
  shall be on every hand in all her streets."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Thomas Ellwood disposes of the city in a very summary manner:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"For this shall be judgment of Babylon (saith the Lord); in one day
  shall her plagues come upon her, <i>death</i>, and <i>mourning</i>, and
  famine, and she shall be utterly burnt with fire; for great is the Lord
  who judgeth her."&mdash;<i>Alarm to the Priests</i>, Lond. 1662.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>George Fox also claims to have had a distinct prevision of the fire
  (See <i>Journal</i>, p. 386., ed 1765.) He also relates the story of a
  Quaker who was moved to come out of Huntingdonshire a little before the
  fire, and to&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Scatter his money up and down the streets, turn his horse loose,
  untie the knees of his breeches, and let his stockings fall down, and to
  tell the people 'so they should run up and down scattering their money
  and goods, half undressed, like mad people, as he was a sign to them,'
  which they did when the city was burning."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Lilly's celebrated book of <i>Hieroglyphicks</i>, which procured the
  author the dubious honour of an examination before the committee
  appointed to inquire into the origin of the fire, is well known. In one
  of the plates, a large city, understood to denote London, is enveloped in
  flames; and another rude woodcut, containing a large amount of graves and
  corpses, was afterwards interpreted to bear reference to the Plague.
  Aubrey seems to be a <!-- Page 174 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page174"></a>{174}</span>little jealous of the renown which Lilly
  acquired by these productions for he asserts that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Mr. Thomas Flatman (poet) did affirm that he had seen those
  <i>Hieroglyphicks</i> in an old parchment manuscript, writ in the time of
  the monks."&mdash;<i>Misc.</i>, p. 125. ed. 1721.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Nostradamus also, more than a century before, is said to have foretold
  the very year of the burning. In the edition, or reputed edition, of
  1577, cent. ii. quatrain 51., is the following:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Le sang du jusse à Londres fera faute</p>
      <p>Bruslez par foudres de vingt trois les six</p>
      <p>La dame anticque cherra de place haute</p>
      <p>De mesme secte plusieurs seront occis."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Those of your readers who incline to dubiety on this subject, I refer
  to the copy from whence it was taken, in the Museum Library, press-mark
  718. a 14. If it is a forgery (and such I take it to be), it is decidedly
  the best I ever met with. Some time ago the Queries of your correspondent
  <span class="sc">Speriend</span> elicited some interesting particulars
  relative to Nostradamus and his prophecies; but I do not think the
  question of his claim to having predicted the death of Charles I. was
  finally decided.</p>

  <p>I should be glad if any of your correspondents could tell me whether
  the quatrain above, or anything like it, occurs in any of the
  <i>genuine</i> early editions. Dugdale, by the way, evidently believed in
  its authenticity, and has inserted a version in his <i>History of St.
  Paul's</i>.</p>

  <p>Such a promising theme as the destruction of London was, of course,
  too good a thing to escape the chap-book makers. During the period of the
  Civil Wars, we find many allusions to it. In a little quarto brochure,
  published in 1648, entitled <i>Twelve Strange Prophecies</i>, the
  following is placed in the mouth of the much maligned and caricatured
  Mrs. Ann Shipton. The characteristic termination I consider a fine stroke
  of the art vaticinatory.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A ship shall come sayling up the Thames till it come to London, and
  the master of the ship shall weep, and the mariners shall ask him why he
  weepeth, and he shall say, 'Ah, what a goodly city was this! none in the
  world comparable to it! and now there is scarce left any house <i>that
  can let us have drinke for our money</i>.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This string of notes, turned up at different times, and while in
  search of more important matter, can no doubt be materially increased
  from the collections of your correspondents. If my researches prove
  interesting, I may trouble you with another paper: at present I leave the
  facts brought together above to the candid investigation of your
  readers.</p>

<h3>EXAMPLES OF THE FRENCH SIZAIN.</h3>

  <p>The epigram (if it may with propriety receive that appellation)
  printed in Vol. vi., p. 603., reminded me of some similar pieces of
  composition stored in my note-book; and as they are not devoid of a
  certain degree of curious interest, I now forward them <i>pro bono
  publico</i>.</p>

  <p>On Luther, Calvin, and Henry VIII., the leaders of the
  Reformation:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Vous, dont le sens est encore sain,</p>
      <p>Fuyez Luther, Henri, Calvin.</p>
      <p>Vous, dont le c&oelig;ur n'est point flétri,</p>
      <p>Fuyez Calvin, Luther, Henri.</p>
      <p>Vous, à qui le salut est cher,</p>
      <p>Fuyez Henri, Calvin, Luther."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>On the death of Francis II.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Par l'&oelig;il, par l'oreille, et l'épaule,</p>
      <p>Trois rois sont morts naguère en Gaule;</p>
      <p>Par l'épaule, l'oreille, et l'&oelig;il,</p>
      <p>Trois rois son entrés au cercueil;</p>
      <p>Par l'épaule, l'&oelig;il, et l'oreille,</p>
      <p>Dieu a montré grande merveille."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>By Beaumarchais:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Connaissez-vous rien de plus sot</p>
      <p>Que Merlin, Bazire, et Chabot?</p>
      <p>Non, certes, il n'est rien de pire</p>
      <p>Que Chabot, Merlin, et Bazire;</p>
      <p>Et nul ne vit-on plus coquin</p>
      <p>Que Chabot, Bazire, et Merlin."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A more modern one still, date 1842:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"L'Etat est fort mal attelé</p>
      <p>Avec Thiers, Guizot, ou Molé;</p>
      <p>L'Etat marche tout de travers,</p>
      <p>Avec Molé, Guizot, ou Thiers;</p>
      <p>Vers l'abîme il court à galop,</p>
      <p>Avec Molé, Thiers, ou Guizot."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The prophecy in the last two lines has been unfortunately
  fulfilled.</p>

<h3>EPIGRAMS.</h3>

  <p>The two epigrams which follow were communicated to me many years ago
  by the Rev. George Loggin, M.A., of Hertford College, long one of the
  masters of Rugby School. He died July 15, 1824, at the age of forty; and
  this reminiscence of their old tutor's name will be welcomed by many a
  Rugbæan. They were represented to have proceeded from the pen of Thomas
  Dunbar of Brasenose, who, from 1815 to 1822, was keeper of the Ashmolean
  Museum. I have never seen them in print, or even in writing. They were
  recited <i>memoriter</i>, and from memory I write them down; and hence,
  no doubt, there will be some deviations from the true text. But they seem
  too good to be lost; and I am not <!-- Page 175 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page175"></a>{175}</span>without hope that a
  correct copy may eventually be elicited from some of your
  correspondents.</p>

  <p>With regard to the first, whether the lines were really made on the
  occasion stated, or the occasion was invented (as I am inclined to
  suspect) to suit the lines, is perhaps not very material:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Reply to Miss Charlotte Ness, who inquired the meaning</i></p>
      <p><i>of the logical terms</i> <span class="sc">Abstract</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Concrete</span>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"'Say what is <i>Abstract</i>, what <i>Concrete</i>?</p>
      <p class="i1">Their difference define.'</p>
      <p class="hg1">'They both in one fair person meet,</p>
      <p class="i1">And that, dear maid, is thine.'</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'How so? The riddle pray undo.'</p>
      <p class="i1hg1">'I thus your wish express;</p>
      <p>For when I lovely Charlotte view,</p>
      <p class="i1">I then view loveli-<i>Ness</i>.'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>On a certain D.D. (who, from a peculiarity in his walk, had acquired
  the <i>sobriquet</i> of Dr. Toe) being jilted by Miss H&mdash;&mdash;,
  who eloped with her father's footman:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"'Twixt Footman Sam and Doctor Toe</p>
      <p class="i1">A controversy fell,</p>
      <p>Which should prevail against his foe,</p>
      <p class="i1">And bear away the belle.</p>
      <p>The lady chose the footman's heart.</p>
      <p class="i1">Say, who can wonder? no man:</p>
      <p>The whole prevail'd above the part,</p>
      <p class="i1hg1">'Twas <i>Foot</i>-man <i>versus</i> <i>Toe</i>-man."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I should like to ascertain the author of the following:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>The Parson</i> versus <i>Physician</i>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"How D.D. swaggers&mdash;M.D. rolls!</p>
      <p class="i1">I dub them both a brace of noddies:&mdash;</p>
      <p>Old D.D. takes the cure of souls,</p>
      <p class="i1">And M.D. takes the care of bodies.</p>
      <p>Between them both what treatment rare</p>
      <p class="i1">Our souls and bodies must endure!</p>
      <p>One takes the <i>cure</i> without the <i>care</i>,</p>
      <p class="i1">T'other the <i>care</i> without the <i>cure</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Balliolensis.</span></p>

<h3>GOE, SOULE, THE BODIES GUEST."</h3>

  <p>I have a cotemporaneous MS. of this wonderfully-fine poem, that came
  into my possession with a certain rare bunch of black-letter ballads,
  printed between the years 1559 and 1597, and all of them unique (of the
  said bunch, Mr. Editor, more hereafter), which contains two additional
  verses not to be found in <i>A Poetical Rhapsodie</i>, compiled by
  Francis Davison, and "printed by William Stansby for Roger Jackson,
  dwelling in Fleet Street, neere the great Conduit, 1611;" nor in <i>Poems
  by Sir Henry Wotton, Sir Walter Raleigh, and others</i>, carefully edited
  by the Rev. John Hannah, M.A., and published by my friend William
  Pickering in 1845. They are prefaced by the word "Additions." They are
  written on the same leaf, and in the same quaint hand, and are as
  follow:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Tell London of their stewes,</p>
      <p class="i1">Tell marchants of their usury;</p>
      <p>And, though it be no newes,</p>
      <p class="i1">Tell courtyers of theyr lechery;</p>
      <p>And if they will reply,</p>
      <p class="i1">They best deserve the lye.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Let cuckolds be remembred,</p>
      <p class="i1">I will not dye theyr debtor;</p>
      <p>Theire heads beying armed,</p>
      <p class="i1">Theyl beare the brunt the better;</p>
      <p>And if they chaunce reply,</p>
      <p class="i1">Theyr wives know best they lye.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Having compared this MS. with the poem as it is printed in the
  above-mentioned volumes (both of which are in my library), I find it
  contains several variations, not however very important. Though these
  "Additions," in good taste, expression, and power, do not equal the noble
  verses that precede them, they are interesting and curious, and well
  worthy of preservation. After much inspection and inquiry, I have not
  discovered that they have ever yet appeared in print. The cabinet in
  which they slept, and the company they kept (undisturbed, it would
  appear) for more than two centuries, assure me that they have not been
  published.</p>

  <p>If you, Mr. Editor, or any of your many friends desire to see this
  MS., say so, and you and they shall be welcome. It has been in my
  possession (unseen) twenty years.</p>

<h3>PETITIONS FROM THE COUNTY OF NOTTINGHAM.</h3>

  <p>The documents, copies of which I inclose, are written on the blank
  leaves in a copy of Willett's <i>Hexapla</i>, edit. 1611. I should be
  glad to know if the petitions, of which they are drafts, or rather
  copies, were presented, and <i>when</i>? There is no date to the
  petitions; but the copy of a letter, on another blank page, which seems
  to be in the same handwriting (signed "William Middleton"), is dated
  February 5th, 1658. Any information regarding the parties whose names are
  appended to the petitions would be acceptable.</p>

  sins of these nations, partly through the malice of Satan, the diuisions
  of brethren, the secret and subtile practices of Romish emissaries,
  fomenting errors and heresies, and not a little, as we humbly conceive,
  through the want of church gouernment, settled and established by the
  ciuil authority, whereby those unto whom the exercise of church power is
  committed by Christ may be impoured to keep back ignorant and prophane
  persons from polluting the ordinances of God, as alsoe by reason of some
  ancient lawes, alledged and urged by diuers as yet in force, injoyning
  ministers to dispense the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, without
  affording them (as we conceiue) sufficient power regularly to keep back

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Lancashire Fairy Tale.</i>&mdash;The nursery rhymes in one of your
  late Numbers remind me of a story I used to be told in the nursery. It
  was, that two men went poaching, and having placed nets, or rather sacks,
  over what they supposed to be rabbit-holes, but which were in reality
  fairies' houses, the fairies rushed into the sacks, and the poachers,
  content with their prey, marched home again. A fairy missing another in
  the sack, called out (the story was told in broad Lancashire dialect)
  "Dick (dignified name for a fairy), where art thou?" To which fairy Dick
  replied,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i3hg3">"In a sack,</p>
      <p class="i3">On a back,</p>
      <p>Riding up Barley Brow."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The story has a good moral ending, for the poachers were so frightened
  that they never poached again.</p>

  <p class="author">T. G. C.</p>

  <p><i>Teeth, Superstition respecting</i> (Vol. vi., p. 601.).&mdash;A
  similar (perhaps the same) piece of childish superstition respecting the
  teeth is, that when the upper incisors are large, it is a sign that you
  will live to be rich.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Furvus.</span></p>

  <p><i>New Moon Divination.</i>&mdash;Being lately on a visit in
  Yorkshire, I was amused one evening to find the servants of the house
  excusing themselves for being out of the way when the bell rang, on the
  plea that they had been "hailing the first new moon of the new year."
  This mysterious salutation was effected, I believe, by means of a
  looking-glass, in which the first sight of the moon was to be had, and
  the object to be gained was the important secret as to how many years
  would elapse before the marriage of the observers. If one moon was seen
  in the glass, one year; if two, two years; and so on. In the case in
  question, the maid and the boy saw only one moon a-piece. Whether the
  superstition would, in this instance, be suggestive to their minds of
  anything to be deduced from the coincidence, I do not know; but as they
  were both very old-fashioned folks, I suppose the custom may not be
  unknown to those learned in Folk Lore.</p>

  <p>What is the orthodox mode of conducting this kind of divination?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Oxoniensis.</span></p>

  <p><i>The Hyena an Ingredient in Love Potions.</i>&mdash;In Busbequius's
  <i>Letters</i> (Elzevir, 1633) I note that the Turks consider the hyena
  useful in love potions. I extract the passage:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In amatoriis ei vim magnam Turcæ, ut etiam veteres, tribuunt, cumque
  essent duæ eo tempore Constantinopoli, mihi tamen vendere gravabantur,
  quod se Sultanæ, hoc est, principis uxori, eas reservare dicerent, quippe
  quas philtris et magicis artibus animum mariti retinere, recepta in
  vulgus (ut dixi) opinio est."&mdash;P. 84.</p>

  <p><i>The Elder Tree.</i>&mdash;I was visiting a poor parishioner the

  <p>"Pray, Sir, can you tell me whether there is any doubt of what kind of
  wood our Lord's cross was made? I have always heard that it was made of
  <i>elder</i>, and we look carefully into the faggots before we burn them,
  for fear that there should be any of this wood in them."</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>The Word "Party."</i>&mdash;Our facetious friend <i>Punch</i> has
  recently made merry with the modern use of the word "party," as applied
  to any absent person concerned in any pending negotiation. It was used
  thus, however, by William Salmon, professor of physic, in his <i>Family
  Dictionary</i>, 1705:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Let the party, if it can be agreeable, rub frequently his teeth with
  the ashes that remain in a pipe after it is smoaked."&mdash;P. 315.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Having cooled it, rub the party's mouth with a little of it,"
  &amp;c.&mdash;P. 321.</p>

  <p class="author">E. D.</p>

  <p><i>Epitaphs.</i>&mdash;Churchyard literature presents to us some
  curious specimens of metaphor; and it is interesting to observe how an
  old idea is sometimes unintentionally reproduced. The following lines may
  be seen on a gravestone in the churchyard at Kinver, Staffordshire:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Tired with wand'ring thro' a world of sin,</p>
      <p>Hither we came to <i>Nature's common Inn</i>,</p>
      <p>To rest our wearied bodys for a night,</p>
      <p>In hopes to rise that Christ may give us light."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 178 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>{178}</span></p>

  <p>The writer was probably not aware that Spenser says, in his <i>Faerie
  Queen</i>, iii. 3. 30.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And if he then with victorie can lin,</p>
      <p>He shall his days with peace bring to his <i>earthly In</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And again, <i>Faerie Queen</i>, ii. 1. 59.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Palmer, quoth he, death is an equall doome</p>
      <p>To good and bad, the <i>common In of rest</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A Leicestershire poet has recorded, in the churchyard of Melton
  Mowbray, a very different conception of our "<i>earthly Inn</i>." He
  says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>This world's an Inn</i>, and I her guest:</p>
      <p>I've eat and drank and took my rest</p>
      <p>With her awhile, and now I pay</p>
      <p>Her lavish bill, and go my way."</p>

  <p>You may, perhaps, consider this hardly worthy of a place in your
  paper; but I act upon the principle which you inculcate in your
  motto.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Erica.</span></p>

  <p><i>Campbell's "Pleasures of Hope."</i>&mdash;It has often occurred to
  me that in two lines of the most celebrated passage in this
  poem,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"O'er Prague's proud arch the fires of ruin glow,</p>
      <p>Her blood-red waters murmuring far below,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>the author has confounded Prague, the capital of Bohemia, with Praga,
  the suburb of Warsaw. The bridge over the Moldau, at the former place, is
  a stone one of European celebrity; and to it Campbell must have referred
  when using terms not at all applicable to that over the Vistula, which is
  of much humbler form and material.</p>

  <p>In Campbell's "Ode to the Highland Society on 21st March," he
  describes the 42nd Regiment as having been at Vimiera, which it assuredly
  was not; and no Highland regiment was in the battle except the 71st. I
  suspect he confounded the "Black Watch" with the distinguished corps next
  to it on the army list,&mdash;an error into which the author of
  <i>Charles O'Malley</i> also must have fallen, as he makes Highlanders
  form a part of the Light Division, which consisted of the 43rd, 52nd, and
  95th.</p>

  kind in existence. It is mentioned by Jeremy Taylor as the inscription
  somewhere on a font. Letter by letter it reads the same, whether taken
  backward or forwards:</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Agricola de Monte.</span></p>

  <p><i>"Derrick" and "Ship's Painter."</i>&mdash;The following Note may
  perhaps interest some of your readers:&mdash;The ancient British word
  <i>derrick</i>, or some such word, still exists in our marine. It is used
  in sea phrase to define a crane for temporary purposes, and is not
  unusually represented by a single spar, which is stepped near a hatchway,
  provided with a tackle or purchase, in order to the removal of goods from
  the hold of a vessel. The use of <i>Derry</i>, both as a termination in
  the names of places, and in the old ballad chorus of <i>Down derry
  down</i>, is familiar to every one.</p>

  <p>Some other of our sea terms might receive apt illustration in "N.
  &amp; Q.;" and I should beg to suggest "unde derivatur" a boat's
  <i>painter</i>,&mdash;the name of the rope which confines a ship's boat
  to the vessel, when at sea.</p>

  <p>Turner gave a world-wide interest to the phrase when he called, in his
  eccentric manner, one of his finest marine pictures "Now for the
  painter."</p>

  <p class="author">J. C. G.</p>

  <p class="address">Tavistock Square.</p>

  <p><i>Lord Reay's Country.</i>&mdash;Formerly the parish of Durness
  comprehended the whole of the district known as "Lord Reay's country,"
  or, as it is called in Gaelic, "Duthaic Mhic Aoi," <i>i. e.</i> the land
  of the Mackays, extending from the river of Borgie, near Strathnaver, to
  the Kyle of Assynt, and comprehending a space of about 800 square miles!
  Since 1734 it has been divided into three parishes, viz. Eddrachillis,
  Durness, and Tongue, with the parish of Farr: it was disjoined from the
  presbytery of Caithness, and by an act of the Assembly attached to the
  presbytery of Tongue.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>UNANSWERED QUERIES.</h3>

  <p>I think it may be permitted to Querists, who may fail in obtaining
  answers, to recur to their questions after the lapse of a reasonable
  time, in order to awaken attention. I asked a question at page 270., Vol.
  vi., in which I was, and still am, much interested. Perhaps <span
  class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> will do me the favour to answer it,
  particularly as his annotated folio is remarkably rich in "<i>stage
  directions</i>."</p>

  <p>Before taking the liberty of putting the question so directly to <span
  class="sc">Mr. Collier</span>, I awaited an examination of his
  recently-published volume of selected corrections, in which, however, the
  point upon which I seek information is not alluded to.</p>

  <p>In glancing over that volume, I perceive that <span class="sc">Mr.
  Collier</span>, in his notes at the end (p. 508.), does "N. &amp; Q." the
  honour to refer to it, by alluding to an emendation "proposed by <span
  class="sc">Mr. Cornish</span>" ("N. &amp; Q.," Vol. vi., p. 312.).</p>

  <p>When that emendation appeared I recognised it at once as having been
  proposed by Warburton and applauded by Dr. Johnson. I did not, however,
  then think it of sufficient importance to trouble the editor of "N. &amp;
  Q.," by correcting a claim which, although apparent, might not perhaps be
  intentional. <!-- Page 179 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page179"></a>{179}</span></p>

  <p>But now, since the ownership (<i>quantum valeat</i>) has deceived even
  <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span>, and is endorsed by him, it is time
  to notice it.</p>

  <p class="author">A. E. B.</p>

  <p class="address">Leeds.</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;I may add that, with respect to these words "happy low lie
  down," from my habit of looking for solutions of difficulties in
  parallels and antitheses, I have arrived at a different conclusion from
  any that has yet been suggested. Finding "uneasy" used <i>adverbially</i>
  in the last line, I see no reason why "happy" should not also be taken
  <i>adverbially</i> in the preceding line: we should then have the same
  verb, "lie" and "lies," repeated antithetically in the same mood and
  tense.</p>

  <p>The article <i>the</i> before "low" has probably been omitted in the
  press, and may be either actually restored or elliptically
  understood:</p>

<h3>MR. JOHN MUNRO.</h3>

  <p>Between the years 1803 and 1830, a gentleman resident of London, under
  the signature A. Z., presented from time to time to the Society of
  Antiquaries of Scotland, a collection of works respecting the Orkney and
  Shetland islands, copiously illustrated with manuscript notes and
  inserted prints, maps, &amp;c. The internal evidence leaves no room to
  doubt that the donor of this valuable collection was a native of
  Kirkwall; and recent investigations lead to the conclusion that he was a
  Mr. John Munro, originally in the office of Mr. John Heddle, Town Clerk
  of Kirkwall. He appears to have gone to London about 1789, and to have
  passed the rest of his life there, down to May, 1830, when his last
  communication was made to the Scottish Antiquaries. A list of his
  donations is printed in the <i>Archæologia Scotica</i>, vol. iii. pp.
  267-274. His copious manuscript notes, written in a very neat and legible
  hand, indicate not only a man of intelligence and research, but also of
  an exceedingly amiable and kindly disposition, and strongly influenced by
  the <i>amor patriæ</i>, which gave to his donations their exclusive
  character.</p>

  <p>I am anxious to ascertain what was Mr. Munro's occupation in London,
  the date of his death, and any interesting or characteristic notes
  concerning him. Judging from his tastes, it seems highly probable that he
  may have been known to more than one of your metropolitan
  correspondents.</p>

  <p>Perhaps you will not think such Queries undeserving of a corner in
  your useful vehicle of literary intercommunication, nor A. Z.'s
  <i>anonimity</i> unworthy of an effort to rede the riddle.</p>

  and it is probable that they may be able to give me some information
  respecting a Mr. R. S. Townshend, a person of literary taste and
  pursuits, who resided in that town about the year 1730. His Common-place
  Book, or Diary, which has fallen into my hands, contains numerous
  allusions to the leading gentry and clergy of the neighbourhood; and more
  than once it mentions the well-known Dr. Byrom, under the title of "Il
  Gran Maestro de Tachigraphia." Dr. Deacon, a distinguished person among
  the Nonjurors, is also mentioned. The acting of Cato by the scholars of
  the grammar-school on Dec. 20, 1732, is also mentioned, with some
  critiques upon the performers. The elections at the collegiate church are
  constantly referred to as subjects of all-absorbing interest; there being
  a strong party, <!-- Page 180 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page180"></a>{180}</span>as well in the town as in the church, of
  Jacobites, and these elections being regarded as a trial of party

  <p><i>The Cadenham Oak.</i>&mdash;Can any of the correspondents of "N.
  &amp; Q." inform me if this famous old tree is still alive? It flourished
  for nearly three centuries in Hampshire Forest; and during this long
  period was visited by crowds of people, who, it must be confessed,
  entertained towards it a religious veneration&mdash;from its peculiarity
  of annually shooting forth its buds on old Christmas-day. If dead, as I
  suppose&mdash;for the account which I read some years ago stated that it
  was fast decaying&mdash;then I would like to know if the young tree, one
  of its progeny, is still flourishing in the forest, and enjoying, from
  its peculiarity, the same veneration <!-- Page 181 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>{181}</span>which was paid to the
  parent stock. Those of your readers who wish to know more of this
  venerable oak, and of the trees which sprung from it, are referred to Mr.
  Gilpin's able and interesting work on forest scenery, published, as I
  believe, in London between sixty and seventy years ago.</p>

  <p><i>Derivation of "Lowbell."</i>&mdash;I see <span class="sc">Mr.
  Sternberg</span>, in his "Dialect and Folk-lore of Northamptonshire,"
  gives a new explanation of the puzzling word <i>lowbell</i>, in Beaumont
  and Fletcher's <i>Woman's Prize</i>, Act I. Sc. 3. It appears that
  Northamptonshire peasants have a way of their own for punishing offenders
  against good morals:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On the first appearance of the culprit in 'strit,' or on 'grin,' the
  villagers rise <i>en masse</i>, and greet him with a terrible din of tin
  pots and kettles, &amp;c.; and, amidst the hooting and vociferation of
  the multitude, he is generally compelled to seek shelter by flight. This
  is called 'lowbelling,' and the actors are termed 'lowbells,' or
  'lowbellers,' forming a tolerable explanation of the <i>lowbell</i> in
  Beaumont and Fletcher's <i>Woman's Prize</i>, Act I. Sc. 3., which has so
  long mystified the commentators:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'<i>Petru.</i> If you can carry't so, 'tis very well.</p>
      <p><i>Bian.</i> No, you shall carry it, Sir.</p>
      <p><i>Petru.</i> Peace, gentle <i>Lowbell</i>.'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

</blockquote>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Sternberg</span> derives it from the Anglo-Saxon
  <i>lowian</i>, past participle of the Anglo-Saxon <i>lowian</i>, and the
  verb <i>bellan</i>. This would seem satisfactory; but I should like to

  idea, which agrees with Mr. Lane in his account of the modern Egyptians,
  who derives it from the Arabic word "<i>Hushhusheen</i>, one drunk with
  hemp." M. Volney says it comes from the Arabic "<i>Hass</i>, to kill, or
  lie in ambush to kill." Which of all these derivations is correct?</p>

  Columb, St. Mewan, St. Erben, St. Eval, St. Wenn, and St. Enedor." It
  appears that these missionaries landed in Cornwall at Pendinas,
  hill-head, now called St. Ives; for in the Legend of St. Ives, contained
  in <i>Nova Legenda Angliæ</i>, we read that "Tewdor was king at that
  time, and had a palace at Pendinas; and that Dinan, a greate lord of
  Cornwall, at the request of St. Iä, built a church at the same place."

<h3>THE ORKNEY ISLANDS IN PAWN.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 105.)</p>

  <p>It gives me much pleasure to be enabled to inform your correspondent
  <span class="sc">kirkwallensis</span> that there is no fear of our losing
  these islands in the manner suggested by him, they having been renounced
  by Denmark nearly four hundred years ago, as will be seen from the
  following sketch.</p>

  <p>The Orkneys were taken from the Picts about <span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 838, by Kenneth II., king of Scotland, to which
  kingdom they were attached until 1099, when Donald VIII., surnamed Bane,
  brother to Malcolm Canmore, usurped the crown, to the prejudice of his
  nephews Edgar, Alexander, and David; and requiring assistance to maintain
  his position, he applied to Magnus, king of Norway, to whom, says Skene,
  "for help and supply he gave all the isles of Scotland (Camden says the
  Orkneys only), where, through and for other causes, many bloody battles
  were fought, until the battle of Larges, 3rd August, 1260, in the time of
  Alexander III. of Scotland, and Acho, king of Norway." The Scots proving
  victorious, Magnus of Norway, son and successor of Acho, made peace with
  Alexander, and renounced and discharged all right and title which he or
  his successors had, or might have or pretend, to the isles of Scotland,
  the king of Scotland paying therefor yearly to the said Magnus and his
  successors one hundred marks of sterling money. This contract was
  confirmed in 1312 by Haquin V. of Norway and Robert I. of Scotland. In
  1426 Eric X. of Denmark renewed with James I. of Scotland these ancient
  treaties, particularly with regard to the Western Isles; the pension or
  annuity having been long omitted to be paid, Eric now freely gave it up
  to James; and thus, in appearance, the Orkneys were finally confirmed to
  Scotland; but virtually it was not so until 1468, when, says Skene, "at
  last the said annual, with all the arrearages and by-runs thereof, was
  discharged and renounced <i>simpliciter</i>, in the contract of marriage
  between King James III. and Margaret, daughter of Christian I., king of
  Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, on the 8th of September, 1468; which
  discharge is not only ratified, but renewed thereafter by the said king,
  on the 12th May, 1469. It appears that James III., on the 24th February,
  1483, commanded his ambassador sent to the Pope to desire a confirmation
  of the said perpetual renunciation and discharge of the contribution of
  the Isles."</p>

  <p>According to Dr. Wallace's account (1700), King Christian agreed that
  the isles of Orkney and Zetland should remain in the possession of King
  James and his successors, as the Princess Margaret's dower, until either
  King Christian or his successors should pay to King James or his
  successors the sum of fifty thousand florins of the Rhine; but in the
  year following, hearing of his daughter's delivery of a prince at
  Edinburgh, he "for joy thereof renounced for ever to the crown of
  Scotland all right or claim to the said isles."</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Broctuna.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Bury, Lancashire.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Kirkwallensis</span> seems to have been led into an
  error respecting the Orkneys. It is true that Orkney and Shetland
  belonged to the crown of Norway, to which the Scottish family of St.
  Clair, or Sinclair, rendered military service for the earldom. It was
  not, however, to an English king, but to James III. of Scotland that
  Christian gave the hand of "the Maid of Norway." In the marriage
  preliminaries the latter thus stipulates respecting the dower:&mdash;"Rex
  cedit sexaginta aureorum Rhenensium [florenorum] millia, ejus summæ
  priusquam è Danæ regno sponsa digrediatur numeraturus aureorum decem
  millia, quod verò reliquum esset supplerent insulæ regni Norvegici, jam
  memoratæ, <i>Orcades</i>, una cum jurisdictione ac cæteris eodem
  pertinentibus, hac tamen lege, ut insulas eas, eousque teneat Scotiæ Rex
  sub firma <i>hypotheca</i> donec vel ipse, vel ejus heredes, Daniæ ac
  Norvegiæ Reges, æqua vicissim portione easdem redimant." This article was
  afterwards embodied in the marriage contract:&mdash;"Et terræ insularum
  Orchaden Regi nostro Jacobo <i>impignoratæ, ad Norvegiæ reges
  revertentur</i>," &amp;c. Both documents are preserved in Torfæus
  (<i>Orcades</i>, pp. 188&mdash;191.). Mr. Auker's discovery of the
  original is, however, an interesting circumstance, as it would seem that
  the marriage in question was but the result of an attempt to settle
  amicably an ancient dispute respecting the sovereignty of the
  Hebrides&mdash;"vetus controversia de Hæbudis et Mannia magnis utriusque
  populi cladibus agitata"&mdash;which the king of France, as umpire, had
  been unable to pronounce upon, in consequence of the loss or concealment
  of the original instruments.</p>

<h3>THE PASSAGE IN KING HENRY VIII., ACT III. SC. 2.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., pp. 5. 111.)</p>

  <p>Having no desire to enter into unnecessary controversy, I do not often
  reply to objections made to my conjectural emendations of passages in
  Shakspeare; but on the present occasion I think it incumbent on me to
  appeal to the common sense of those who take interest in such matters, by
  merely placing in juxta-position the reading I have proposed, and that of
  your Leeds correspondent, and thus leave it to their impartial decision
  without fear of the result. It may be necessary, as your correspondent
  has adverted to <!-- Page 184 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  stands in the folio at some length. Wolsey having said&mdash;</p>

  </div>

  <p>For his arguments I must refer to his note (p. 111. <i>antè</i>),
  merely observing that I cannot conceive how any alteration in the
  punctuation of the King's speech could connect it with this! Making
  <i>That</i> emphatic helps nothing, as there is no antecedent to which it
  can refer; and if "we can by no means part with <i>have</i>," we must
  interpolate <i>been</i> after it to make it any way intelligible, to the
  marring of the verse.</p>

  <p>With regard to the substitution of <i>lack</i> for <i>crack</i> in my
  former note, it should be recollected that I then said "I do not insist
  upon this." We might, however, substitute <i>slack</i>, if change should
  be deemed necessary, and it would be still nearer in form to the
  suspected word.</p>

  <p>I may safely leave the <i>palpable</i> error in <i>As You Like It</i>
  to the decision of common sense.</p>

  <p>As I am dealing with corrections in the play of <i>King Henry
  VIII.</i>, I may take occasion to observe that <span class="sc">Mr.
  Collier</span>, in his recent supplemental volume of <i>Notes and
  Emendations</i>, has, I have no doubt unwittingly, stated that a passage,
  Act IV. Sc. 2., has been absurdly pointed, "over and over again, from the
  year 1623 to our own day." Whereas it will be found corrected, exactly as
  it stands in his second folio, in the edition I gave of Shakspeare in
  1826, with a note adverting to the absurdity of the old pointing. I may
  further add, that the first instance <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span>
  gives in his preface of the corrections in his folio, is in the same
  predicament. He has stated that the reading of "Aristotle's
  <i>cheeks</i>" for "Aristotle's <i>ethics</i>," in the first scene of the
  <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>, "has been the invariable text from the first
  publication in 1623 until our own day;" when the fact is, that it stands
  properly corrected in my edition in 1826, with the following note:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Blackstone suggests that we should read <i>ethics</i>, and the sense
  seems to require it; I have therefore admitted it into the text."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is possible that <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> may have never
  looked into my edition of the poet, and I may honestly say that I regret
  it, not on my own account but on his, for I think, had he consulted it,
  his own would not have been the worse for it.</p>

<h3>MINIATURE RING OF CHARLES I.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 578.)</p>

  <p>By the courtesy of W. K. Rogers, Esq. (in whose possession it is), I
  am enabled to account for another of these interesting and invaluable
  relics; one of the four said to have been presented by the Martyr prior
  to his execution.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="ac">"<span class="sc">Rogers of Lota.</span></p>

  <p>This family was early remarkable for its loyalty and attachment to the
  Crown; a ring is still preserved as an heir-loom, which was presented to
  its ancestor by King Charles I. during his misfortunes."&mdash;Burke's
  <i>Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Robert Rogers of Lota received extensive grants of land from Charles
  II., which upon the accession of James II. were confirmed to him by
  letters patent. He was Mayor of Cork, 1680, M. P. for that city 1692, and
  again 1695. In the body of his will, bearing date 1690, and registered in
  the Record Court, Dublin, occurs the following <!-- Page 185 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>{185}</span>paragraph, embraced by
  brackets, as if he wished to convey forcibly his appreciation of the
  value of the relic:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>["And I also bequeath to Noblett Rogers the miniature portrait-ring of
  the martyr Charles I., given by that monarch to my ancestor previous to
  his execution; and I particularly desire that it may be preserved in the
  name and family."]</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The miniature, which is beautifully painted in enamel, and said to be
  by Vandyke, has been reset in a tasteful and appropriate style; and it is
  in this state that I have seen it. But Mr. Rogers informs me that its
  original setting and inscriptions exactly corresponded with those of the
  ring in the possession of the Misses Pigott, described in Hulbert's
  <i>History of Salop</i>; and the same tradition exists in the family as
  to its having been <i>one of four</i> presented by Charles to certain of
  his friends or followers. There can be little question, therefore, as to
  the genuineness of both these rings. With regard to the portrait being
  the work of Vandyke, Mr. R. writes to me&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I know not on what authority it is stated, but I believe there is not
  a family of old standing in the county Cork in which tradition has not
  assigned its execution to that master; and certainly in Rome, where it
  was much admired, the artists, when questioned 'Whose style?' frequently
  answered, 'Vandyke.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Portraits by Vandyke in enamel, it is said, are known to be in
  existence. Whether so renowned a master would have submitted to the
  wearisome and laborious operation of repeating a number of works so
  minute, even for a crowned head, seems to admit of a doubt; yet there is
  no difficulty in imagining him to have superintended the progress of the
  artist employed to copy his own portrait of Charles, and even to have
  bestowed some finishing touches upon it.</p>

  <p>I have lately seen a ring with a portrait of Charles on ivory, in
  coarse and very inferior style, and in a plain gold setting. It is in the
  possession of a gentleman in whose family it has continued for several
  generations. Doubtless many such memorials of their murdered king were
  worn at the time by his devoted partizans, and may yet be in
  existence.</p>

<h3>CHANTRY CHAPELS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 223.)</p>

  <p>At the Derby Congress of the British Archæological Association, the
  Duke of Rutland exhibited a document of which the following notice by Mr.
  H. N. Black is made in the Journal of their <i>Transactions</i> (vol. for
  1851, p. 297.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A bull of Pope Alexander IV., dated at Viterbo, 2 id. Mar., anno 4,
  viz., 14 March, 1258. It is addressed to the Bishop of Coventry, setting
  forth that Richard de Herthull lived in a place remote from the mother
  church, which at some seasons was inaccessible; that he already had a
  chapel on his own land, and desired to have a chaplain to serve therein,
  for whom he was prepared to provide fit support. The matter was therefore
  referred to his diocesan, to grant license accordingly if he should deem
  it expedient. The leaden seal is yet attached to this beautiful little
  document."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Then follow the words of the document in Latin.</p>

  <p>Herthull has been corrupted into <i>Hartle</i>: and on the moor of
  this name a chapel still remains, although of much later date than that
  mentioned in the above-named document; traces of an earlier erection are
  however still visible in a portion of the present foundations. It is now
  used as a barn. Distant from this about two miles, at Meadow Place, near
  Yolgrave, is another chapel, now used for a similar purpose as the
  foregoing. In this, the jambs of all the windows still remain; the east
  window is a very large one.</p>

  <p>The above is not intended to answer W. H. K.'s Query, but rather as a
  note in connexion with it.</p>

  <p class="author">T. N. B.</p>

  <p class="address">Chester.</p>

  <p>In the North Riding of Yorkshire, celebrated for its monasteries,
  &amp;c., were many chantry chapels, both in the hamlets, and in the rural
  situations apart from them. Gill's <i>Vallis Eboracensis</i> contains an
  account of several; among the rest may be noticed one at Newton Grange.
  This chapel, which is now used for agricultural purposes, is preserved,
  by request of its noble owner Lord Feversham, in its primitive form. It
  stands in a meadow field, at some distance from the ruins of the ancient
  seat of the Cholmeleys, and was used as a burial chantry, but not
  exclusively so. In 1820 a vault was discovered beneath the floor; and
  five coffins were removed to Oswald Kirk churchyard, and re-interred
  there. In order to preserve the chapel from ruin, Lady Cholmeley
  bequeathed one pound per annum to the Rector of Ampleforth for preaching
  a sermon annually therein; but the ruinous state of the building at that
  time caused the removal of the pulpit, and the sermon is preached in the
  church at Oswald Kirk.</p>

  chantries.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC NOTES AND QUERIES.</h3>

  <p><i>The Collodion Process.</i>&mdash;I have been much pleased with the
  directions given by <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span> in your columns
  for the production of collodion positives; but they have been hitherto
  unaccompanied by any reference to the causes of those numerous failures
  that occur in this delicate process, and which are so disheartening to
  <!-- Page 186 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page186"></a>{186}</span>beginners. I will just enumerate a few of
  the appearances with which I have been troubled, and trust that they may
  elicit from other operators an account of some of their instructive
  failures. I will premise, as an answer to a former Query respecting the
  cost and description of lenses, that I obtained mine of Mr. Goddard, now
  of Jesse Cottage, Witton, Middlesex. They are combination-lenses, two
  inches and a quarter in diameter (achromatic); the front lens can be used
  singly for views, producing a picture nearly seven inches square, but
  when combined covering four inches. For these, with brass mounting, I
  paid less than 3<i>l.</i>: a single lens, the same diameter, would be
  about 1<i>l.</i> They work to focus, cover flat, and define well,
  producing pictures equal to the most expensive.</p>

  <p>I have usually preferred Mr. Archer's collodion, as the most certain
  and cleanest. The silver bath is composed of thirty grains nitrate of
  silver and two drops of nitric acid to each ounce of distilled water. An
  even film may be obtained by the following means:&mdash;Represent the
  plate of glass by the following figure:</p>

<table class="mc ba">
<tr><td class="pl1 pr1 pb1 pt1">
1<span class="gap" style="width:4em;"></span>3<br/><br/>2<span class="gap" style="width:4em;"></span>4
</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Hold the plate with the left hand at 1, pour a body of collodion in
  the centre: tilt towards 1 (being careful not to let it touch the thumb),
  incline towards 2, run into 3, and pour off at 4: then hold the plate
  vertically (resting the corner 4 on the neck of the collodion bottle) to
  drain: incline it first to the right and then to the left, repeating this
  several times until the ridges are removed. By these means an even film
  may be produced, without a thick ridge, from 2 to 4. The time it may be
  left before plunging into the silver bath will depend on the temperature
  (about half a minute). Dip evenly into the bath, lifting up and down to
  allow of the evaporation of the ether: the film will also saturate more
  rapidly. When the greasy appearance is gone, it is ready for the camera.
  Sometimes the film is nearly transparent and bluish, not having
  sufficient iodide of silver; or it may contain too much iodide, the
  greater part flaking off in the bath, leaving the collodion with very
  little, and that patchy; or from being placed in the bath too quick, the
  lower corner still present a reticulated appearance, which of course
  renders it useless.</p>

  <p>Having exposed the plate the necessary time, the next step is the
  development. The solution I usually employ is prepared with protosulphate
  of iron. I do not find distilled water absolutely necessary (during the
  summer months I fancied the tones were improved by using ordinary water,
  perhaps from containing a little lime), and the acetate acid is not
  glacial, but a description termed Beaufoy's, much less expensive. The
  proportions are&mdash;</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td> Water</td>
<td> 2 ounces.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Acetic acid</td>
<td> 1 drachm.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr2"> Protosulphate of iron</td>
<td> 8 grains.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Nitric acid</td>
<td> 2 drops.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Mix the water and acetic acid first; then dissolve the iron; and,
  lastly, add the nitric acid, which, by varying the quantity, produces
  different effects. On pouring the solution over the plate, there is
  sometimes a difficulty experienced in causing it to flow evenly.
  Sometimes a little more acetic acid in the developing solution, or, if
  the plate has been out of the bath some time, redipping it, will prevent
  this; but if this does not remove it, and the resulting picture is hard
  and unpleasant in tone, a new bath is necessary. For positives, the
  resulting picture is more pleasing and delicate by using the developing
  agent rather weak. After it has remained on sufficiently long to bring
  out the image, the undecomposed iodide is to be removed by hyposulphite
  of soda. I always use the same solution, pouring it on and off until
  exhausted. Having sufficiently washed, the picture may perhaps appear
  with many black spots, this may in future be obviated by adding a little
  alcohol to the collodion:&mdash;or it may be covered with white spots; in
  that case the collodion requires settling, or rapidly filtrating through
  an old piece of loose silk. Sometimes it will look all black and white (a
  common fault with collodion positives), without middle tints: by adding a
  little more acetic acid, or an extra drop of nitric acid, to the
  developing solution, or the addition of a few drops of ordinary
  pyrogallic solution, this disagreeable effect may be overcome. In taking
  portraits, it is often caused by having the sitter placed with too much
  front light. Then, again, the should-be whites of the picture may be dull
  and greenish by reflected, and red by transmitted, light. This effect I
  generally find remedied by putting less nitric acid in the developing
  solution. During the development, by watching the colour (by holding a
  piece of white paper underneath), this red tendency may be observed; in
  that case the drawing may be preserved by leaving the plate for about a
  minute after pouring the developing agent off, and before removing the
  iodide. Some change appears to take place by its contact with the air; it
  gradually gets more opaque, and when finished, though not so white as
  many, yet presenting an extremely rich brownish-yellow tone.</p>

  <p>During the late dull weather, many of my plates have shown a tendency
  to an uniform leaden-looking deposit, destroying the blacks of the
  picture. A little more nitric acid in the bath will sometimes overcome
  this, but I have not yet found a sufficient remedy. During the summer
  months I was in the habit of using double the quantity of <!-- Page 187
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187"></a>{187}</span>iron I have
  stated, diluting the solution more; then was compelled to diminish the
  quantity to twelve grains, and now I use eight. I have tried the
  proportions recommended by French photographers, but they seem to contain
  too large a proportion of iron. I prefer the use of the protosulphate to
  the protonitrate of iron from its cheapness, and the ease with which it
  is made up. It will also keep for any length of time, rather improving
  than otherwise.</p>

  <p>I back with liquid jet from Suggitt, opposite the House of Correction,
  Mount Pleasant, Clerkenwell. It dries rapidly, and brightens the
  appearance.</p>

  <p class="author">G. H. P.</p>

  <p><i>Mr. Weld Taylor's Iodizing Process.</i>&mdash;The process I sent to
  your columns last month, for iodizing paper, is applicable <i>only</i> to
  the paper of Canson Frères; and I may further explain, that if the
  solution does not answer well, it may be washed over again with a
  solution of iodide of potassa only of the usual strength, and then set on
  a dish of slightly-acidulated water, to assist the separation and set
  free the potash. To make the matter clear to <span class="sc">Mr.
  Shadbolt</span>, I may observe, to one who is in the habit of iodizing
  paper, a considerable amount of the passage relating to cyanide of
  potassa could not be misunderstood; the nitrate of silver being added to
  the iodide of potassa, forms at once a precipitate which it is required
  to take up. The old double iodide says, add iodide of potassa till it
  does so, and it will do so; but the cyanide of potassa does it much
  better, and the cyanogen is lost as the paper dries, otherwise it would
  take no image at all. In the process I gave it merely requires an
  equivalent, "and cyanide of potassa is always of use in many of these
  processes." That equivalent is of course best arrived at by a solution,
  as, if the cyanide of potassa were added in the lump, it would be lost or
  be in excess.</p>

  <p>Further, I may enlighten <span class="sc">Mr. Shadbolt</span> by
  assuring him that the iodizing paper with the ammonio-nitrate of silver,
  which I never saw published yet, is the best way; and I may confidently
  assert that the better ways of iodizing papers are not published at all.
  It is a tedious process to do, but it is as certain as taking a positive
  from a negative. At present I have not space to give my way of doing it.
  I may also add, that it will not answer with all papers. In fact, all
  samples of paper require some modification of the process, as the
  chemicals are different in the various modes of bleaching paper by
  different manufacturers. The ammonio-nitrate is perfect with Whatman's
  paper; indeed it is a subject of much regret, that this maker has not
  turned out a paper as thin and hard as the Canson Frères. The latter
  gentlemen have added some chemical, probably iodine, to their paper,
  which renders it almost impossible to iodize it at all. I believe it to
  be iodine, because the paper becomes perfectly black over <i>free</i>
  iodine, which no English paper will do. At all events, this paper is very
  uncertain, although it has a quality in appearance that is unsurpassed by
  any other.</p>

  <p><i>Sir William Newton's Process: Further Explanations.</i>&mdash;In
  reply to your correspondent <span class="sc">F. Maxwell Lyte</span>, who
  is desirous of knowing my motive for washing the paper over with chloride
  of barium previous to iodizing&mdash;</p>

  <p>In the first place, I find that it appears to give strength to the
  paper.</p>

  <p>Secondly, that the action in the camera is better and more
  certain.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, it keeps cleaner in the bringing-out process, thereby
  allowing a longer time for a more complete development.</p>

  <p>Fourthly, I have never found any <i>solarizing</i> take place since I
  have used it (about three years); and, fifthly, I find that it keeps
  longer and better after it is excited for the camera.</p>

  <p>From the observations which I have made since I have made use of
  chloride of barium, I conclude that it has the effect of
  <i>destroying</i> any injurious properties which may be in the paper, and
  more especially with respect to the <span class="sm">SIZE</span>; and
  besides which, when combined with iodide of silver, greater intensity is
  obtained in the negative.</p>

  <p>I have occasionally prepared paper without chloride of barium, but I
  have always found (except for positives) that I could not rely upon it
  with the same degree of certainty. I need scarcely add that throughout
  the whole of this process the greatest care and attention is required,
  and that the water should be constantly agitated while the paper is in
  it, and that the water should be once changed.</p>

  <p><i>Tuch</i> (Vol. vii., p. 82.).&mdash;<span class="sc">Alphage</span>
  suggests that the "touchstone" had its name because "a musical sound may
  be produced by touching it <!-- Page 188 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page188"></a>{188}</span>sharply with a stick." I think this is an
  error, and that it owes its name to its use in the assay of gold and
  silver. We find this application of it described in a work (now scarce)
  published in 1677, under the title of <i>A Touchstone for Gold and Silver
  Wares</i>. The author, after describing the qualities of a good
  touchstone, observes (p. 36.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The way to make a true touch on the touch-stone is thus: When your
  touch-stone is very clean ... your silver being filed ... rub it
  steadily, and very hard, on the stone ... until the place of the stone
  whereon you rub be like the metal itself ... wet all the toucht places
  with your tongue, and it will show itself in its own countenance."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And that the touchstone was used in this connexion at a much earlier
  period is obvious from the language of the ancient statutes. The 28
  Edward I., stat. 3. cap. 20., requires all gold and silver wares to be
  "of good and true allay, that is to say, gold of a certain <i>touch</i>."
  And the word occurs in the same sense in other statutes.</p>

  <p>The error of Coleridge, alluded to by your correspondent <span
  class="sc">Alphage</span>, is certainly not a little singular, especially
  as the word, in the sense of stone or marble, occurs in Ben Jonson,
  Drayton, and Sir John Harrington, and there is a good article on the word
  in Nares's <i>Glossary</i>. I must, however, altogether dissent from your
  correspondent's statement that the reason for the name of Touchstone is,
  that a musical sound may be produced by touching it sharply with a stick,
  and agree with Nares that it obtained its name from being used as a test
  for gold. See a very interesting article on Assay Marks by Mr. Octavius
  Morgan (<i>Archæological Journal</i>, ix. 127.), from which it appears
  that, for the trial of gold, touch-needles were applied to the
  touchstone.</p>

  <p><i>Eva, Princess of Leinster</i> (Vol. vi., p. 388.).&mdash;O'Haloran,
  in his <i>History of Ireland</i>, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>In 1168, Dermot Mac Murchad, King of Leinster, having carried away
  Dearbhorgie, wife of O'Ruark, prince of Breffin, was driven from his
  kingdom by the husband, assisted by the lady's father, the King of
  Meath.</p>

  <p>"He arrived at Bristol, having obtained letters patent of Henry II.
  for any of the king's subjects to assist him against his enemies: but no
  one in Bristol was found able or willing to undertake such expedition,
  when Strongbow, Earl of Pembroke, who resided at Chepstow Castle, offered
  his assistance (Seyer's <i>Memoirs of Bristol</i>); and, in 1169, entered
  Ireland with two hundred knights and others, to the number of 1000. The
  object being effected, Strongbow was united to Eva, the daughter of
  Dermot; and, at that prince's death, became seised of Leinster."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>By this it appears, that Dermot eloped with the lady in 1168; and, as
  Strongbow was united to Eva the following year, Eva consequently could
  not have been the offspring of that connexion. Who her mother was, I am
  unable to find out.</p>

  representations of a bird, which in every particular of shape is
  identical with the extinct fowl of Mauritius. What is more curious is,
  that the natives were familiar with the figure as that of "the sacred
  bird," which is common on the Buddhist monuments throughout the island;

  <p>Some weeks ago, on looking over a box of old Kentish deeds and papers,
  P. C. S. S. found a lease, signed by his ancestor Sir John Fineux, on the
  6th of October, 1522, to which is affixed a seal in perfect preservation,
  bearing what P. C. S. S. has hitherto erroneously supposed to be the
  crest of the Fineux family, viz. an eagle displayed. He is now, however,
  indebted to your correspondent (Vol. vi., p. 83.) for the conviction that
  it must be a Dodo, and that it can represent nothing else. For it is of
  "unwieldy form," has "disproportionate wings," and is altogether of a
  "clumsy figure." P. C. S. S. has till now believed that the uncouth
  appearance of the bird was owing to the want of skill in the artist. But
  it is now clear that it must undoubtedly be a Dodo; and P. C. S. S. will
  henceforward live, <i>sibi carior</i>, in the certainty that the chief
  justice of England temp. Henry VIII., from whom he has the honour to
  descend, bore a "veritable Dodo" as his crest.</p>

  correspondent L. G. T. of Lichfield yet remains unanswered. "The cavern"
  he refers to is that called Llech, and concerning which he has fallen
  into several errors. The cavern, so far from having been lately
  discovered, has been known for generations past, and is yearly visited by
  hundreds of strangers. If the entrance has been made as private and
  inaccessible as possible, there is nobody to blame but nature and time;
  for the ancient approach was from the summit of the cliff by means of a
  flight of stone and grass steps, of which traces still remain connected
  with an old stone wall. The cave is easily descried from the sea-shore
  below, whence it can be reached by the aid of a common ladder. The shape
  is not heptagonal, as stated by L. G. T.; but is semi-octagonal,
  terminated in front by two square columns of freestone. The front and
  seats are in perfect preservation; but of the stone table, which many
  years ago occupied the centre, the pedestal only remains. The font, or
  rather stone basin, is supplied by a spring of most delicious water,
  which, at certain seasons, flows in copious quantities into an artificial
  bath excavated in the rock below. It is said that the cave was fitted up
  as a grotto, or pleasure-house, by some ancestors of the Mostyn family;
  and this is all that is known about it. I have measured the principal
  dimensions, and find the quantities given by L. G. T. sufficiently
  accurate.</p>

  <p><i>Martin Drunk</i> (Vol. v., p. 587.).&mdash;I cannot find that this

  throw some additional light on the subject.</p>

  <p>In an <i>Analysis of the Gospels for the Lord's Days</i>, by Conrad
  Dieteric, edit. 1631, p. 465., I read:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Tritum est illud veterum veriverbium:</p>

  <p>It would seem from this, that not the English alone were wont to enjoy
  themselves on St. Martin's Day. Baxter, in his <i>Saint's Rest</i> (p.

  really a local habitation, and where?" This is a Query full of grave
  suggestions. Are there not hundreds of epitaphs in print which have no
  existence except as printer's paragraphs, and which serve the same
  purpose as the immortal calf with six legs, and the numberless gigantic
  gooseberries and plethoric turnips. I have collected epitaphs for years
  past, and it is surprising how many&mdash;and those some of the best in a
  literary sense&mdash;defy every attempt to trace them to sepulchral
  sources. Besides epitaphs, I believe many sham quotations are used by
  writers, such as couplets and queer phrases of their own coining; but
  which are inclosed between inverted commas, either to rid their authors
  of the responsibility of the sentiments they convey, or to add weight to
  the argument they are introduced to illustrate. A short time since, I
  contributed a tale to a journal; at the head of each chapter stood a
  couplet of my own composing, which the printer and editor both mistook
  for a series of quotations, and kindly affixed inverted commas to them;
  and, as in that instance I did not receive proof slips to correct, the
  tale was published, adorned with these sham quotations&mdash;the reader
  being bamboozled without intention, and I robbed of the credit of my
  original couplets. This is an important matter: for it is no pleasant
  affair to spend a month or two in the endeavour to trace a quotation, and
  then to become convinced that you have been hunting for a mare's
  nest.</p>

  not many, or most of the so-called <i>eagles</i> on lecterns in churches,
  <i>pelicans</i>? The symbolical significance of the pelican "vulning its
  breast," as the heralds have it, is well known. Some of these, which I
  remember well, have the beak bent down upon the breast and beneath it,
  instead of the indications of plumage elsewhere visible, a strip
  cross-hatched; in sign, as I have supposed, of the flowing blood.</p>

  <p><i>Passage in Wordsworth</i> (Vol. vii., p. 85.).&mdash;I can refer
  your Edinburgh correspondent, who asks for "an <i>older</i> original for
  Wordsworth's graceful conceit," to the following lines by Henry
  Constable, an Elizabethan poet, who published, in 1594, a volume of
  sonnets entitled <i>Diana</i>; and whose "ambrosiac muse" is lauded by
  Ben Jonson in his <i>Underwoods</i> (Gifford, vol. viii. p. 390.):</p>

  <p>These lines, which I find in the notes to Todd's <i>Milton</i> (vol.
  v. p. 454., edit. 1826), being addressed "To the King of Scots whom as
  yet he had not seen," must have been written before 1603, and were first
  printed on a MS. volume by Todd in his first edition, 1801; where
  Wordsworth, who was no reader of scarce old tracts like "Diana Primrose's
  Chain of Pearl," may very probably have seen them.</p>

  <p><i>Smock Marriages</i> (Vol. vi., p. 561.).&mdash;In reference to your

  and that instances have been known where children born out <!-- Page 192
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192"></a>{192}</span>of wedlock
  have been legitimatised, on the marriage of their parents, by being
  placed beneath the mother's apron, and having the string tied over them,
  during the ceremony.</p>

  <p><i>La Bruyère</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 38. 114.).&mdash;There lies before

  former, which commences with Ralph de Bruera (temp. William I.), has been
  compiled from papers in the Heralds' Office, Brompton, Dugdale, and the
  more modern historians, general and local. The last individual mentioned
  therein is a physician, who bore the name and ancient arms of Brewer, and
  died in 1618. The pedigree embraces about sixty names, including the
  alliances, but reaches no further downwards than the sons of Roger
  Mortimer in the reign of Henry III. These documents do not contribute in
  any way to answer the inquiry of one of your correspondents as to La
  Bruyère; and it may be satisfactory to the other to know that there is
  nothing in them to show any connexion with the name of De la Bruere.</p>

  <p><i>Murray, titular Earl of Dunbar</i> (Vol. vi., p. 11.).&mdash;In
  correcting Lord Albemarle's mistake respecting "James Murray,
  <i>titular</i> Earl of Dunbar," your correspondent C. (2.), Portsmouth,
  seems to have fallen into a similar error, which I hope he will pardon me
  for pointing out.</p>

  <p>The Christian name of <i>Murray of Broughton</i> was not <i>James</i>,
  but <i>John</i>; and the ancient Border family to which he belonged was
  so distinctly connected with that of Stormont (a branch of Tullibardine),
  that even genealogical tradition was silent. His activity as an agent
  recommended him to Prince Charles, who employed him as his secretary
  during the campaign of 1745, to the misfortunes of which he added by
  fomenting the Prince's distrust of Lord George Murray: and his final
  treachery to his master and his cause has condemned him to an immortality
  of infamy. He had nothing in common with "James Earl of Dunbar," save the
  name which he disgraced and the cause which he betrayed.</p>

  <p>James Murray, second son of Lord Stormont, and elder brother of the
  famous Lord Mansfield, escaped to the court of the exiled Stuarts after
  1715. He became governor to the prince; and under the title of Earl of
  Dunbar, chief minister and secretary to his father. He never returned to
  Scotland, but died in 1770 at Avignon, at the age of eighty. His
  honorable fidelity to a ruined cause is admitted even by Junius, when,
  "willing to wound," he taunts Mansfield with this Jacobite connexion;
  while the intensity of loathing with which Scotland viewed his infamous
  namesake is illustrated by the anecdote of old Walter Scott throwing the
  cup out of the window, lest "lip of him, or his, should come after John
  Murray of Broughton."</p>

  <p><i>Loggerheads</i> (Vol. v., p. 338.).&mdash;As I do not find that any
  correspondent of "N. &amp; Q." on the subject of the sign of "We Three"
  has mentioned the existence of a similar sign in a small village in
  Denbighshire, on the border of Flintshire, to which a curious tradition
  is attached, I am induced to forward the account of it. The last years of
  Wilson, the landscape painter (who died in 1782), were passed at a house
  called Clomendu, the dove-cote, situated on a property to which he had
  succeeded in the little village of Llanoerris, through which the high
  road from Mold, his burial-place, to Ruthin passes. Wilson was fond of
  ale, and is <!-- Page 193 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page193"></a>{193}</span>traditionally said to have frequented a
  small inn close by the roadside (on the right hand as you pass through
  the village from Mold towards the vale of Clwyd), and to have spent many
  an hour upon the bench under a tree which was lately, and is perhaps
  still standing opposite. His friend the landlord, wanting a new sign, or
  more probably a restoration of the old established one, Wilson painted
  for him the heads of two very merry red-faced men, who are looking hard,
  with a broad grin, towards the spectator. Long exposure to the wind and
  weather had, when I saw them, nearly obliterated the original colouring
  of the heads, and I have heard that some Dick Tinto has of late years
  restored the rubicund hue to their cheeks: but the words "We Three
  Loggerheads Be" were quite legible ten years ago. The innkeeper, who sets
  a very high value on this sign, is, I believe, a son of the man for whom
  Wilson painted it. It is not attached to a pole, but fastened against the
  front of the inn: and a few years ago, an idea prevailing that "The
  Loggerheads" had been painted on the back of an unfinished landscape, an
  artist offered the innkeeper a sum of money to be allowed to take it
  down, and ascertain the fact. But it was indignantly refused, with a
  protest that the sign which Wilson had painted should never be removed
  from its place, as long as he lived.</p>

  Thorney, as appears by the dedication. It is the same as that printed by
  Capgrave, who omits the dedication. Fulcard wrote the lives of certain
  other saints buried at Thorney (Torhtred and Tancred). The dedication
  does not belong exclusively to the life of Botulph, but forms the
  introduction to all three lives. It was for this reason, I suppose, that
  Capgrave (or rather John of Tynemouth, from whom he borrowed) omitted
  it.</p>

  would be taken of them by placing them under the official safeguard of
  the Prussian minister; and his decision was, that they were not to be
  published till after the lapse of fifty years from the prince's death,
  which took place in 1822. Copies, however, of the original
  <i>Mémoires</i> had been surreptitiously taken before their seclusion
  from the public eye; and from these copies, important and extensive
  extracts are said to have been undoubtedly made, and form part of the
  printed <i>Mémoires</i>. In editing them, several well-known literary men
  were employed; among whom are enumerated, Alphonse de Beauchamp, A.
  Schubart, and Count A. F. D'Allonville. A Mons. Montveran (the author, I
  believe, of a work on English jurisprudence) announced, some years ago, a
  publication, in which he promised to disclose the original sources of the
  <i>Mémoires</i> and the compilers' names; but, so far as I can discover,
  M. Montveran has never redeemed his promise.</p>

  <p><i>Age of Trees</i> (Vol. v., <i>passim</i>).&mdash;In the <i>Saturday

  class="pagenum"><a name="page194"></a>{194}</span>of Owen Glendower's
  Oak, at Shelton, near Shrewsbury,&mdash;a tree famed from the tradition
  attached to it, which states that the celebrated chieftain whose name it
  bears overlooked, from its branches, the desperate battle which took
  place between Henry IV. and Sir Henry Percy, on the 20th July, 1403.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There is no difficulty, in believing," says E. B., "from the present
  appearance of the tree, that it is old enough to have been of a
  considerable size in the year 1403. Oaks are known to live to a much
  greater age than this; and there are documents which prove that the
  Shelton Oak was a fine large tree some centuries ago. It is perfectly
  alive, and bears some hundreds of acorns every year, though it has great
  marks of age, and is so hollow in the inside, that it seems to stand on
  little more than a circle of bark. At least six or eight persons might
  stand within it.</p>

  <p>"The girth at the bottom, close to the ground, is 44 feet 3 inches; at
  five feet from the ground, 25 feet 1 inch; at eight feet from the ground,
  27 feet 4 inches. Height of the tree, 41 feet 6 inches."</p>

  <p><span class="sc">St. Mary's Church</span>, Vincent Square,
  Westminster, was erected in the year 1837, and contains 1,200 sittings,
  of which 800 are free.</p>

  <p>The pecuniary resources which were at the disposal of those by whose
  efforts this spacious Church was built were only adequate to provide what
  was absolutely requisite for the performance of Divine Service.</p>

  <p>There was, however, much cause for thankfulness that so large and
  commodious a Church was raised in so poor a district as St. Mary's; and a
  hope was then entertained that the day would soon come when what was
  necessarily left incomplete might be accomplished.</p>

  <p>Fifteen years have passed away since the Church was consecrated; and
  the time appears now to have arrived when an effort should be made to
  supply what is wanting, and to render the interior more convenient, to
  paint, cleanse, and colour it; and to impart to it that religious decency
  and comeliness which befits the House of God.</p>

  <p>An additional reason for this endeavour is supplied by recent events.
  Churches have arisen in the neighbourhood of St. Mary's, erected by the
  munificence of pious founders, which are adorned with architectural
  beauty, and are among the best specimens of ecclesiastical fabrics that
  the present age has produced. St. Mary's suffers from the contrast: its
  deficiencies have become more manifest; and the need of such an effort as
  has been mentioned is now felt more strongly.</p>

  <p>While, however, the exigencies of the case have increased, the means
  of satisfying them have become less. Some of the less indigent portions
  of St. Mary's District have been detached from it, and have been annexed
  to the other districts formed for more recent Churches. Thus the
  resources of St. Mary's have been diminished; and circumstances of a
  local character render it undesirable, in the opinion of legal advisers,
  to press for the levying of a Rate for the improvement of the Church.
  Perhaps, however, the strength of the present appeal may eventually be
  found to lie in these difficulties, when they are more generally
  known.</p>

  <p>A <span class="sc">Committee</span>, therefore, has been formed,
  consisting of the Churchwardens of the District, and other inhabitants,
  and of some personal friends of the Incumbent, the REV. A. BORRADAILE,
  whose zeal and energy in discharging the duties of the pastoral office in
  St. Mary's District for more than ten years, through many and great
  difficulties, have been greatly blessed to his flock, and command the
  respect and sympathy of those who have witnessed his persevering
  exertions, and have seen the fruit of his labours.</p>

  <p>The Committee are now engaged in an endeavour to raise funds for the
  reparation and improvement of the interior of St. Mary's Church; and they
  trust that many may be found to approve and encourage the design.</p>

  <p>An estimate has been prepared of the requisite expenditure by MR. H.
  A. HUNT, of 4. Parliament Street, which amounts to <span class="sc">Five
  Hundred and Fifty Pounds</span>. This sum, it is anticipated, will
  suffice to provide for lowering and refixing the whole of the Free Seats,
  and to make them more commodious for the use of the poor; to improve the
  seats generally throughout the Church; to alter and improve the position
  and character of the Pulpit and Reading Desk; to paint, grain, and
  varnish the whole of the seats; and so give an appropriate appearance to
  the Chancel of the Church.</p>

  <p>THE PRACTICAL WORKING of THE CHURCH OF SPAIN. By the Rev. FREDERICK
  MEYRICK, M.A., Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Pleasant meadows, happy peasants, all holy monks, all holy priests,
  holy every body. Such charity and such unity, when every man was a
  Catholic. I once believed in this Utopia myself, but when tested by stern
  facts, it all melts away like dream"&mdash;<i>A. Welby Pugin.</i></p>

  <p>"The revelations made by such writers as Mr. Meyrick in Spain and Mr.
  Gladstone in Italy, have at least vindicated for the Church of England a
  providential and morally defined position, mission, and purpose in the
  Catholic Church."&mdash;<i>Morning Chronicle.</i></p>

  <p>"Two valuable works ... to the truthfulness of which we are glad to
  add our own testimony: one, and the most important, is Mr. Meyrick's
  'Practical Working of the Church of Spain.' This is the
  experience&mdash;and it is the experience of every Spanish
  traveller&mdash;of a thoughtful person, as to the lamentable results of
  unchecked Romanism. Here is the solid substantial fact. Spain is divided
  between ultra-infidelity and what is so closely akin to actual idolatry,
  that it can only be controversially, not practically, distinguished from
  it: and over all hangs a lurid cloud of systematic immorality, simply
  frightful to contemplate. We can offer a direct, and even personal,
  testimony to all that Mr. Meyrick has to say."&mdash;<i>Christian
  Remembrancer.</i></p>

  <p>"I wish to recommend it strongly."&mdash;T. K. <i>Arnold's Theological
  Critic.</i></p>

  <p>"Many passing travellers have thrown more or less light upon the state
  of Romanism and Christianity in Spain, according to their objects and
  opportunities; but we suspect these 'workings' are the fullest, the most
  natural, and the most trustworthy, of anything that has appeared upon the
  subject since the time of Blanco White's
  Confessions."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

  <p>"This honest exposition of the practical working of Romanism in Spain,
  of its everyday effects, not its canons and theories, deserves the
  careful study of all, who, unable to test the question abroad, are
  dazzled by the distant mirage with which the Vatican mocks many a
  yearning soul that thirsts after water-brooks pure and
  full."&mdash;<i>Literary Gazette.</i></p>

  <p>SYMPATHIES of the CONTINENT, or PROPOSALS for a NEW REFORMATION. By
  JOHN BAPTIST VON HIRSCHER, D.D., Dean of the Metropolitan Church of
  Freiburg, Breisgau, and Professor of Theology in the Roman Catholic
  University of the City. Translated and edited with Notes and Introduction
  by the Rev. ARTHUR CLEVELAND COXE, M.A., Rector of St. John's Church,
  Hartford, Connecticut, U.S.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The following work will be found a noble apology for the position
  assumed by the Church of England in the sixteenth century, and for the
  practical reforms she then introduced into her theology and worship. If
  the author is right, then the changes he so eloquently urges upon the
  present attention of his brethren ought to have been made <i>three
  hundred years ago</i>; and the obstinate refusal of the Council of Trent
  to make such reforms in conformity with Scripture and Antiquity, throws
  the whole burthen of the sin of schism upon Rome, and not upon our
  Reformers. The value of such admissions must, of course, depend in a
  great measure upon the learning, the character, the position, and the
  influence of the author from whom they proceed. The writer believes, that
  questions as to these particulars can be most satisfactorily
  answered."&mdash;<i>Introduction by Arthur Cleveland Coxe.</i></p>
